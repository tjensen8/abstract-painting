# Abstract Painting with Neural Networks

In this project, I test out several different methodologies to generate unique takes on abstract art images from Unsplash. The eventual goal of this project is to build out this system into a pi device and run it 24/7 as a piece of art in my home to generate new images.

This project is a work in progress and the files that are here are not entirely complete or production ready. Currently, I am iterating over different approaches to see which generates the best results.
